## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
A Mother's breast:    
Safe refuge from her childish fears,    
From childish troubles, childish tears,    
Mists that enshroud her dawning years!    
see how in sleep she seems to sing    
A voiceless psalm--an offering 
  
  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
Sea-weed, my heart is like    
Your wandering branchesâ€”    
Reft from the deep of peace    
By tossings of great life    
In tide and surge,    
And roaming moorless    
'Neath sun or star,    
Seeking a bourne    
That voice of Chance names not    
Nor Destiny.
